type(content='xxx') # Use escape characters \\', \\\", and \\n in content part to ensure we can parse the content in normal python string format. If you want to submit your input, use \\n at the end of content. 
scroll(point='<point>x1 y1</point>', direction='down or up or right or left') # Show more information on the `direction` side.
wait() #Sleep for 5s and take a screenshot to check for any changes.
finished(content='xxx') # Use escape characters \\', \\", and \\n in content part to ensure we can parse the content in normal python string format.


## Note
- Use {language} in `Thought` part.
- Write a small plan and finally summarize your next action (with its target element) in one sentence in `Thought` part.
